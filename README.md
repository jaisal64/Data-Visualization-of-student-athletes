# Data-Visualization-of-student-athletes

This was a project for the BU sports addmissions committee to help them make better decisions during the college addmissions process.
 
I have worked on a dataset of BU student athlete data to help BU admmission teams analyse which pre-addmission factors are correlated with better performance. 

The jupyter notebook contains a lot of different plots that seek to visualize attributes so that the dataset can be understood better and required correlations can be found by examining them.
